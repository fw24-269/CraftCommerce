# E-commerce Platform Project

This project aims to develop an e-commerce platform with various features.

## Git Branching and Development:

We'll be utilizing feature branching to isolate and develop functionalities independently. Here's an overview of the branches and their purposes:

| **Branch Name**          | **Purpose**                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| feature-product-listing  | Develop functionality for displaying and managing product listings.       |
| feature-shopping-cart    | Develop functionality for adding and managing items in the shopping cart. |
| feature-customer-reviews | Develop functionality for allowing customers to submit and view reviews.  |

## Lessons Learned (To be updated)

As we progress with the project, we'll document key takeaways about using Git in a team environment. This section will cover areas like:

- Branching strategies
- Communication & conflict resolution
- Effective commit messages

By documenting our development process and challenges, we can learn and improve our Git workflow.

**Remember to save your changes to the README.md file.**

**3. Track Your Progress:**

As we work on each feature branch, remember to commit your changes regularly with clear and descriptive messages. This will help you track progress and revert back if necessary.
